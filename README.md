### About the Game of Life

Read about it on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

There is a 2D array of "cells" which can either be "alive" or "dead" (on or off)

> 1. Any live cell with two or three neighbors survives.
> 2. Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
> 3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

### How to Use

- Click or drag to fill a cell

- Right click to toggle a cell

- Hit the play button (or space or enter) to toggle play/pause

- Hit the step button (or right arrow) to step through each state

- Hit the clear button (or backspace or delete) to clear the grid

- Use the mouse scroll wheel to zoom in/out

- Use the up and down arrow keys to speed up or slow down
